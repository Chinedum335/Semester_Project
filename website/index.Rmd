# Overview

Welcome to my Cystopteridaceae Phylogeny Project!

The major goal of this project is to build a **species-level phylogeny** of the Cystopteridaceae ferns using nuclear gene loci from the most recognized species of the family. Cystopteridaceae is a family of small or medium-sized ferns that live in forests and crevices. The family contains 3 genera and about 50 species. This study provides more insight into the evolutionary relationship in the Cystopteridaceae family. 
The content of this digital book is organized in the following Chapters:

Chapter 2: Database design and architecture


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
