# Data Assembly {#data-assembly}

The sequence data used in this study were assembled using PURC (Pipeline for Untangling Reticulate Complexes). Allopolyploid species are polyploid species with more than two sets of chromosomes that originate from different species. Allopolyploids present a challenge for multilocus phylogenetic inference due to their multiple distinct subgenomes, each of which may have its own evolutionary history. Generating sequence data from allopolyploid lineages is challenging due to the difficulty in isolating the sequences of each of the distinct homoeologous gene copies. Recent advances in polyploid phylogenetics have made it possible to effectively undertake phylogenetic study of groups that comprise polyploids. PURC is a pipeline for inferring the underlying biological sequences (alleles, paralogs, or homeologs) from amplicon sequencing data (PacBio, Illumina, etc), de-multiplexing them (labeling each sequence with its locus and source sample), and cleaning them (removing PCR errors, sequencing errors, and chimeras). It is geared toward analyzing polyploid species complexes but is also effective for other applications; the final output of a full PURC run includes an alignment for each locus with each homeolog or allele sequence in the amplicon data labeled with the source sample information and amount of coverage. The figure below shows the workfloe of PURC.

In this study, I used PURC to assemble the underlying sequences of four c. 1-kb-long nuclear loci from a sample of Cystopteridaceae accessions comprising 9 diploid species and 2 polyploid species.The reads of these sequences were generated using the PacBio platform.
A detailed instructions on PURC installation, how to prepare input files as well as additional information for troubleshooting can be found in the README file in the [PURC repository](https://bitbucket.org/peter_schafran/purc/)
