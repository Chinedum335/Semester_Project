### Welcome to my Cystopteridaceae Phylogeny Project!
The major goal of this project is to build a species-level phylogeny of the Cystopteridaceae ferns using nuclear gene loci from the most recognized species of the family. Cystopteridaceae is a family of small or medium-sized ferns that live in forests and crevices. The family contains 3 genera and about 50 species. This study provides more insight into the evolutionary relationship in the Cystopteridaceae family. 
This project contains five folders
The first folder is the folder that contains the raw data. 
The second folder is the folder that contains all the processed data. There are 4 subfolders in the processed data folder. This is because there are four stages of data processing and cleaning in this project. The subfolders include:
1)the automatic alignment of the sequences,
2)manual alignment of the auto- aligned sequences and exclusion of the regions that are not well aligned, 
3) cleaning of the aligned sequences (deleting the regions that were excluded) and 4)concatenating all the aligned sequences. 
The third folder in the main directory is the folder that contains all the results of the phylogenetic analysis. 
The fourth folder is the folder that contains all the phylogenetic trees which are the output of my results. This folder contains two subfolders. All the raw trees created after analysis are saved in the raw tree subfolder and all the trees processed to produce publication-quality figures are saved in the processed tree subfolder. 
All the codes used in this project are saved in the fifth folder which is the code folder.
